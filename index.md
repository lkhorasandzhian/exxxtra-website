# Functional Programming Lab: Write Your Own Compiler/Interpreter

The goal of this lab is to invent your own functional programming language and develop an interpreter/compiler for it.

You may do this lab in the group of 2 or 3 people (or more - but this requires approval from the lecturer):

* 2 people - compiler/interpreter + sample programs + short documentation in README.md (feel free to replace this file with your own documentation)
* 3 people - compiler/interpreter + sample programs + more detailed documentation in GitHub Pages
* 3+ people - in addition to above, this may include some of the following:
  - in-browser IDE
  - Jupyter Notebook support
  - Translation to JavaScript, so that you can execute the program in browser
  - VS Code Extensions

## Task

Your goal would be to invent and implement your own functional programming language. The requirements are:

* It has to closely follow functional programming paradigm, based on either [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) or [Combinatory Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic).
* It has to be more or less Turing-complete, i.e. implement recursion
* You should be able to program and run a function to calculate factorial.

> Keep in mind that writing parsers is a tedious task, so try to keep the syntax of the language as simple as possible. 

For inspiration:

* Look into [LISP](https://books.ifmo.ru/file/pdf/1918.pdf) - a programming language with very simple syntax
* Combinatory parsers and [fparsec](https://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/) library, if you want to implement a language with more complex syntax
* [Top-Down Parser in F#](https://github.com/fholm/Vaughan)
* Interesting blog post on [Parsing in F#](https://www.erikschierboom.com/2016/12/10/parsing-text-in-fsharp/)
* Parsing using [FsLex and FsYacc tooling](https://realfiction.net/posts/lexing-and-parsing-in-f/) (not recommended)
* Implementation of [Scheme in F#](https://github.com/AshleyF/FScheme) - you may look at this project for inspiration, but do not borrow code from there!

## Evaluation Criteria

* Turing Completeness
* Program Samples, including, but not limited to factorial
* Originality and beauty of syntax
* Documentation
* Beauty of implementation

Preferred language for implementation is F#.

In the documentation, please mention explicitly which language features you have implemented:

* [x] Named variables (`let`)
* [x] Recursion
* [ ] Lazy evaluation
* [x] Functions
* [ ] Closures
* [ ] Library functions: File IO
* [x] Lists / Sequences
* [x] Library functions: Lists/Sequences

## Repository

You need to work on the code in GitHub Classroom repo. After you finish the task, it is **highly recommended** to fork this code in your own GitHub accounts, so that is can act as your portfolio.

## Working Step-By-Step

Because the projects is rather big, you need to do it in several stages, checking in your code to GitHub in between:

* Stage 1: Developing abstract syntax tree and parser for your language + one sample program
* Stage 2: Developing interpreter/compiler for your language
* Stage 3: Writing sample programs and documentation

> Of course, you are welcome to modify the language at later stages as you see fit.

## Credits

Do not forget to mention your team in the README.md file, specifying also who did what. Also, README.md should include a short tutorial on your language, and some short code samples.
